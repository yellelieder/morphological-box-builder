# üß† Morphological Box Builder

A flexible, interactive tool for scenario generation using morphological analysis. This application helps users explore complex problem spaces by breaking them down into variants and options, enabling structured creativity and systematic exploration.

## üöÄ Features

- **Variants & Options Management**  
  Define and manage variants (dimensions) and their corresponding options (values) to build a morphological field.

- **Scenario Generation**  
  Combine one option per variant to create and analyze real-world scenarios.

- **Statistics Dashboard**  
  Get insights like total variants, options, possible combinations, and scenario coverage.

- **Scenario Visualization**  
  Visual lines show scenario structures across the morphological box.

- **Undo & Redo**  
  Easily revert or reapply changes.

- **Export & Share**  
  Export your morphological box as a PDF or save/load work using JSON. Share links are also supported.

- **Auto-Save**  
  All changes are automatically stored in your browser.

## üìä Example Use Case

Imagine modeling the properties of fruits and vegetables:

- Define variants like "Color", "Size", "Shape", "Texture", etc.
- Populate each with relevant options.
- Create combinations like "Apple" or "Zucchini" and compare characteristics.
- Export your model or share with others.

## üìà Current App Stats (Example)

- **Variants**: 10
